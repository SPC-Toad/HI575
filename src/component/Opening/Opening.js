        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of World War I, the demand for war assets significantly decreased, leading to strikes, riots, and economic hardship. Concurrently, racial tensions escalated, further straining the societal fabric. The 1917 revolutionary war in the Russian Empire, during which the Bolsheviks (Red Army) overthrew the government, signaled the rise of communism. Amidst this chaos, the United States found itself grappling with the First Red Scare, a significant period that profoundly shaped American society, government policies, and public ideology.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exhibition delves into the societal changes, shifts in government policies, and transformation in public ideology that occurred during this period. The fear and tension that characterized the First Red Scare led to significant shifts in government policies, as evidenced by the Espionage Act of 1917, the Sedition Act of 1918, and the Palmer Raids. These actions, driven by the perceived threat of communism and radicalism, underscored the U.S. governmentâ€™s efforts to neutralize threats to American identity and ideology. However, these courses of action also led to violations of civil liberties, highlighting the tension between national security and individual rights.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stance on this issue is that the U.S. government, in its pursuit of national security, undertook necessary measures. The deportation process, while not perfect, was a crucial step in maintaining the stability and freedom that the United States enjoys today. It is important to acknowledge that law enforcement, like any human institution, can make mistakes. In the heat of the moment, individuals may find themselves at the wrong place at the wrong time, leading to arrests and possible civil rights violations. However, it is my belief that these were unfortunate but necessary sacrifices in the larger battle against the perceived threat of radicalism and communism. The preservation of freedom and democracy on American soil, which we continue to enjoy today, is a testament to the effectiveness of these measures. This exhibition aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics of fear, policy-making, and societal change in the face of perceived threats during the First Red Scare.
